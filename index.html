      The <em>axolotl</em> is awesome because it is
      <strong>pink and cute</strong>! They are from Mexico. The cool thing about
      axolotls is that they can regenerate lost limbs. They eat mollusks,
      crustaceans, and some fish. Unfortunately, they are close to extinction
      because of water pollution and invasive fish that eat axolotl eggs.
